Dear colleagues,

we are pleased to announch the Second Workshop on "Collaboration Mining for Distributed Systems" (CoMinDS 2023) https://pros.unicam.it/comindsto be held in conjunction with ICPM conference, October 23rd, 2023 Universit√† La Sapienza, Rome, Italy 

***Important Dates***
Abstract Submission: August 22, 2023
Papers Submission: August 22, 2023
Acceptance Notification: September 12, 2023

***Theme***
The Second Workshop on Collaboration Mining for Distributed Systems (COMINDS 2023) aims to facilitate the sharing of research findings, ideas, and experiences on new process mining techniques and practices for analyzing collaboration processes. Process mining lacks approaches able to deal with the analysis of collaboration processes implemented by many participants in a distributed system e.g., supply chains involving manufacturers, producers, and retailers; healthcare scenarios involving patients, hospitals, and doctors; or even smart systems like multi-robot and IoT systems. 
In this setting, confidentiality, privacy, data heterogeneity, and case correlation are only a few of the issues related to data preprocessing. Likewise, there is a lack of discovery algorithms, conformance techniques, and enhancement approaches. Thus, there is a need for approaches to support process mining to fill this gap. The main topics relevant to the COMINDS workshop include, but are not limited to:
-Generation of Synthetic Distributed Event Logs
-Distributed Event Logs Preprocessing
-Correlation Mechanisms for Distributed Event Logs
-Discovery of Collaboration Process Models
-Conformance Metrics and Techniques for Collaboration Process Models
-Multi-perspective Analysis of Collaboration Processes
-Privacy-preserving Process Mining for Distributed Systems
-Distributed Systems Monitoring and Repair
-Federated Process Mining
-Streaming Collaboration Mining

***Submissions***
Regular and Short papers must provide original research contributions significant for the workshop theme which have not been published previously. Submissions must use the Springer LNCS/LNBIP format. Submissions must be in English and must not exceed 12 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers. Accepted papers will be published by Springer as a post-workshop proceedings volume in the series Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP). At least one author of each accepted paper must register and participate in the workshop.
Show&Tell presentations could be ongoing research or non-research contributions such as case studies, experiences, lessons learned from projects, industry showcases, and software tool demonstrations significant for the workshop theme. Show&Tell presentations will take place in an interactive and participation-encouraging format based on the number and nature of the accepted contributions. Authors must submit a long abstract of max 2 pages. Show&Tell contributions will be uploaded to the workshop website. At least one author of each accepted Show&Tell must register and participate in the workshop.


Selected, accepted research papers will be considered for publication in an extended and revised form in a special issue to be published in TBD.
The paper should be submitted through the ICPM 2023 submission system https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2023 by selecting the "Collaboration Mining for Distributed Systems" option.
